# cab_route_visualization

## Cab Service Simulation

1. Run <code>main.py</code>
2. Wait for the entire map formation
3. You can move around the map using A, W, S and D keys
4. After the cab is visible, the source and destination can be chosen by clicking on cells on the road which directly takes coordinates of cells as input.
5. One user must choose the first set of source and destination sequentially then another set of source and destination.
6. We can click 2 times on the same source to deselect our choice of source before the destination is chosen, but canâ€™t do the same with destination. 
7. Visualization of the taxi movement on the colored path can be seen clearly.
8. The keyboard key V can be used to focus on cars. Pressing it again focuses on the other car. After seeing all cars, pressing it again brings the normal control back.

### Note : All the requirements of the project are mentioned in the <code>requirements.txt</code> file
